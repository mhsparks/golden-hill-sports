              <p class="has-text-primary has-text-weight-bold">Our set-up</p>

              <p>
                The youth set-up of Golden Hill CC is one of the largest and
                well established in the county. <br />
                Our boys range from 8 to 19 years of age and we cater to players
                with varying ability by focusing on specific needs like
                developing their cricketing skills, ensuring they enjoy the
                game, playing competitive cricket or a combination of the above.
                <br />
                <br />
                We supply top quality players to the Gloucestershire County and
                District age group set up. We have had excellent representation
                during winter training programmes as well as the summer squads
                playing county and district cricket.
                <br />
                Our approach brings success to the club as, on the one hand, we
                win trophies making the club proud and on the other, we focus on
                developing players so they realise their potential.
                <br />
                <br />
                <p class="has-text-primary has-text-weight-bold">Our teams</p>
                We have a number of teams from u11s to u17s playing for the
                Bristol Youth Cricket League (BYCL). We also participate in the
                Gloucestershire Youth Cricket League (GYCL) with a team each at
                u11, u13, u15 as well as their T20 competitions at u16 and u19
                age groups.
                <br />
                Our youth players are encouraged to play adult cricket from the
                age of 13. We have five adult teams playing league cricket on
                Saturdays and a number of youth players play regularly, with
                many talented ones playing 1st/2nd team cricket too.
                <br />
                <br />
                <p class="has-text-primary has-text-weight-bold">
                  Training & Season
                </p>
                Each year, we run a robust indoor winter training programme from
                January to March where we prepare our players for the season
                focussing on batting, bowling and fielding skills. We have ECB
                qualified coaches (Level 2 and 2.5s) supported by adult team
                players and dedicated parents who help run our youth set up. We
                also employ an overseas coach to help all boys, girls and adult
                players during the season.
                <br />
                The league/cup season starts during April and goes on till July,
                with semi finals/finals in August. Each age group trains on a
                specific evening at the club â€“ U10s & 11s train on Mondays, u12s
                & 13s on Thursdays and u14s & u15s on Fridays and the age groups
                above 15 train with adults on Tuesday evenings.

                <p class="has-text-primary has-text-weight-bold">Join Us</p>
                We are a diverse club and welcome everyone to be part of this
                thriving and successful setup. As we are oversubscribed at the
                u11 age group, your son may have to be on the waiting list for a
                little while before joining the club â€“ we will, however, do our
                best to get your son in at the earliest opportunity. <br />
                For any queries about the youth set-up or if interested in
                joining at any age group, please contact Razi Ahmed, Director of
                Youth Cricket on{" "}
